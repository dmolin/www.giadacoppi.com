    <h2 class="project-title">Happy Holidays</h2>
    <h3 class="project-subtitle">Holiday greeting cards</h3>

    <p>Holiday card created for the first Christmas in Vienna, thus aiming to depict the holiday season
    as it is being close to the Alps again, after three years in the heart of Tennessee.<br>
    The lettering was letterpressed by <a href="http://www.tipografiatob.it/" target="_blank">Tipografia Tob</a> (Milan, Italy):
    printed on a coolish-snowy cardboard and wrapped inside a frosty envelope. On the back, one tiny hand stamp as a signature.</p>

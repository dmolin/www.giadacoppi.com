    <h3 class="project-subtitle">Poster</h3>

    <p>When the city of Nashville was hit by the terrible flood in May 2010, among other great community initiatives
    to support the people hit by the catastrophe, Amp, a local printer, asked local graphic designers for a little
    contribution. The poster is mainly typographic, aiming to recount the main shocking facts of that weekend. </p>

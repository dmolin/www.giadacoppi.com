    <h3 class="project-subtitle">Mural</h3>

    <p>A 288x96 inches (24x8 feet) letterpressed mural, located in the coffee shop
    <a href="http://www.baristaparlor.com/" target="_blank">Barista Parlor</a> in Nashville.
    The pixelated image of the sail ship <em>The Prussian</em> is composed of 3072 small paper tiles,
    representing parts of sea creatures. Each tile was letterpressed, cut and glued on the six giant
    panels that make the final mural. </p>

    <p>The cliches for the tiles were cut out in wood by a wonder machine owned by Isle of Printing,
    also home of the proof-press used for printing the tiles in 12 different colors. Once the tiles were cut,
    the massive executive part of the job was to glue them appropriately to recreate the initial image of the ship,
    a job that took a lot of hours, coffees and chocolate.</p>

    <h3 class="project-subtitle">Get-away tags</h3>

    <p>Moving from Tennessee to Vienna is no joke. Created to say goodbye and let people know about the move,
    the tags were letterpressed in black, then date and destination information was stamped in red or blue.
    As a mark of authenticity, luggage weight was handwritten.</p>

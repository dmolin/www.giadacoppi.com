    <h3 class="project-subtitle">Holiday greeting cards</h3>

    <p>No snowflake is identical to another one, and yet their structure, made up of one
    or more ice crystals, often presents a radial symmetry. The card, a hexagonal die cut printed front and back, featured a grid
    based on the structure of snowflakes and invited the recipients to use it
    for designing unique snowflakes and send them back to the studio.</p>
